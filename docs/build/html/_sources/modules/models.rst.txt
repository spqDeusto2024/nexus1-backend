Models Module
==============

The `models` module contains the definitions of database models and response models. The models represent the data structure in the application and are used to interact with the database. The response models define the structure of the data sent back to the client in API responses.

Files in the `models` module:
-----------------------------

- `models.py`: Defines the database models used for interacting with the database.
- `response_models.py`: Contains the response models that describe the structure of the data returned from the API endpoints.

Description:
------------
This module is crucial for handling the data structure of the application. The database models in `models.py` are used for data persistence, while the `response_models.py` helps structure the data that will be returned in the responses to API requests.

==========================
Response Models
==========================

The `response_models.py` file defines the response models that structure the data returned from the API endpoints. These models are not directly related to the database but instead provide a format for the response objects. They ensure consistency in the data returned from various endpoints.

Files:
- `response_models.py`: Describes the shape of the responses returned to the client.

The `response_models.py` includes various models that are used to serialize and return data in the correct format for each endpoint.

The `models.py` file defines the database models for the application. These models are used by SQLAlchemy to create tables, interact with the database, and define relationships between entities. Each model represents a specific entity in the system, such as users, roles, tenants, and more.
